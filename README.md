## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Welcome to the Video Game Discovery App! This app allows you to discover and explore video games using the [RAWG](https://rawg.io/) API as its backend. You can view a list of games, see their platform, ratings, and apply various filters such as name, platform, genre, and more. Additionally, you can access detailed information about each game by clicking on its name.

<br />

### Features

- Confidently build front-end apps with React and TypeScript.
- Implement form validation using Zod.
- Fetch and update data using React Query for improved performance and caching.
- Implement infinite scrolling for seamless browsing.
- Use reducers to consolidate state management logic.
- Manage application state using Zustand.
- Implement routing with React Router for smooth navigation.
- Deploy the app on Vercel for easy access.
